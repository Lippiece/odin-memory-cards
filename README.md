# odin-memory-cards
This is my implementation of a memory cards game where you must click all the shown cards once. 

The difficulty is that you have to keep the selected cards in memory because they shuffle with each click. 
You can add up more cards to make it even harder.

The images shown are sourced from [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos). The source URL looks like `https://picsum.photos/200/500` where numbers 200 and 500 represent the image dimensions and are just generated randomly from 300 to 800.
